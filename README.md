For my final project in computer science for grade 11, I was required to develop a console application that involved working with graphs. Therefore, I decided to create **SpeedyGo**, an app which has the main purpose to generate the most optimal path to supply different deposits in Romania.

In order to successfully set up and run the app, this section will walk you through all the necessary steps. 

- First and foremost, we need to ensure that you have correctly installed the following dependencies: __MySql-Connector-CPP__ for managing the database, __Nlohmann-json__ for working with Json files, and __Curl__ for transferring data using different network protocols.<br>Open your terminal and write the following cmds:<br><br>
```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
1. __MySql-Connector-CPP__
```
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlcppconn-dev
```
2. __Nlohmann-json__
```
$ sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev
```
3. __Curl__
```
$ sudo apt-get install curl
```
- After acquiring the zip file containing the project files, the subsequent action involves extracting them from the compressed archive. To proceed, navigate through the terminal to the directory where you have stored the file. Then, execute the provided command to run the bash script found within the file named "run.sh":
```
$ ./run.sh
